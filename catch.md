Visualize Trends That Matter

### Imagine Retroactive Questions
Ask questions as quickly as you can imagine them. 
Iterate quickly as you dig deep into customer behavior.

### Highly-Targeted Funnel
Setting up funnels is easy, and you can filter a funnel to an exact slice of your userbase. Understand the nature of your conversion rate for your users in China, for anyone who has viewed your Demo video, or for users who signed up and discovered you via Techcrunch.

### Drilldown Into Your Conversions
Split a funnel across different user segments. Answer questions of the form "How do signup conversions change based on the number of case studies a user downloads?", or "How often are new users upgrading to paid plans compared to new users last week?" Funnels can also be segmented by user-level properties such as install date, location, referrer, and UTM parameters.

### Pinpoint Where Users Drop Off
Funnels let you see exactly where users drop off in a multi-step process. How many people hit your home page and end up converting to paid customers? Which step of your registration flow is causing you to lose users?
Slice and dice through retroactive data in real-time. 

Focus on optimization not implementation 

### Capture Everything
Heap automatically captures every user interaction with no extra code.
This includes clicks, taps, gestures, form submissions, page views, and more.

### Point-and-Click Analytics
For the first time, you can setup event-tracking without pushing code. The Event Visualizer lets you define analytics events by simply performing the action yourself. Anyone in your company can setup a conversion funnel or retention report in seconds.

### Retroactive From Day One
Never worry about lost data. Like everything else in Heap, the Event Visualizer defines events across all of your app's historical data. Click on an element, and you'll immediately see retroactive stats on the interaction, ensuring you've pinpointed the right event.

### Data You'll Understand
Keeping track of event names can be confusing. You can't trust your data unless you know exactly what it means. With the Event Visualizer, just hover over an event, and you'll see which element it corresponds to on your website.

### The Easiest Possible Integration
You don't need to write any tracking code. 
Just add events by tapping around your website or iOS app.

### Real-Time Insights
Every report in Heap is real-time, so you don't need to wait hours or days for insights. Dig through the List view to understand what users are doing right now, or generate metrics that reflect up-to-the-minute usage.

### Keep Users Coming Back
You got a new user. Will they come back tomorrow? Next week? Next month?
Learn which factors influence churn and engagement.

### Time-Based Cohort Analysis
With retention, you can answer questions like "After users install our mobile game, how often do they come back and start a new game?" You can split your users into cohorts based on when they complete an action (in this case, the "Install App" event). This lets you visualize how engagement and time-to-activation change over time.

### Meet Your Users
See each one of your users, along with every action they've taken. 
Segment users behaviorally, or attach your own metadata to them.

### User-Level Activity Streams
Heap's List view lets you search for any user and observe every action they've ever done. Use the List view to identify a high-value lead and better tailor your sales pitch, or just explore the unexpected paths people take within your app. Activity is displayed in real-time, so you can see exactly what's happening in your app right now.

### Your Retroactive Analytics Warehouse
Direct SQL access to your retroactive Heap data. 
Automatically managed for you in Redshift. No ETL required.

### Retroactive. Just Like Heap.
Never worry again about data turning stale. Heap SQL is a dynamic data warehouse. Define an event within Heap's UI, and in just a few hours, you can query it in SQL. The best part? Heap SQL includes all historical data for the event from the day you installed Heap.

  
### Direct SQL Access
Enjoy full access to your event data, powered by Amazon Redshift. Let Heap host the data, or host it on your own cluster. Run advanced SQL queries, build custom user models, or join Heap with your own internal data sources.

### Automatically Managed
Don't waste time maintaining an analytics cluster. Tracked a new data point? Deleted an event? No problem. Heap SQL automatically stays in sync with your user data. It even tunes your cluster to ensure the fastest querying speeds.

### Connect to Your Favorite BI Tools
With Heap SQL, you can seamlessly connect your user analytics data to all of your favorite business intelligence tools: Tableau, Domo, Chartio, Looker, GoodData, and more.




### Measure Retention Across User Segments
You can also see how retention changes for different user types. Are you better retaining users from a certain country or referral source? Marketing teams can determine which ad campaigns lead to the most loyal users. Product managers can measure how retention changes across mobile and web form factors.




### Sources
Understand the entire customer journey. 
Unify your customer data from any source. No code required.

### Free your best minds from ETL hell
What would your data team do with 50% more time? No cleaning, joining, and manipulating datasets. Heap automatically collects and organizes touch-points across multiple platforms in the same user-centric schema. Unlock your productivity with a complete data set with integrity.
