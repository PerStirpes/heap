> We are setting up Segments and need to specify only traffic which come from Google Adwords and not Google organic search. 
Can you please explain in detail, how we can just track users through a segment, who have come from any Google Adwords campaign?
We need to set this up urgently, so your detailed explanation would be really appreciated.

> When I view a funnel of people who view our app homepage and click “send email”, I see that roughly 1,500 users in the past month clicked the send email button. However, when I go to the Events tab and view the latter event by itself, it tells me there has been over 2,000 occurrences in the past week. Given that it's impossible to click the send email button without viewing it on the console homepage, could you please explain to me why the funnel over the past month shows that only 1500 people have clicked button over the past month, but the event tab shows that there's been 2000+ occurrences of the event over the past week?

> I was doing some analysis recently on our sign up conversion (see attached image) but I’m getting push back from my boss that these numbers must be wrong. According to this graph, I’m seeing that we only had 2 users come in from AdRoll during this time period but I’m being told that AdRoll is saying there were at least 10x that many users during this time period. We’re in the process of re-evaluating our retargeting spend in advance of our board meeting and I’d really like to know what’s going on and make sure other people can trust Heap. Is there something that I might not be thinking about?

> I’m trying to follow your documentation for adding a Snapshot via JavaScript, however I’m not a developer and I really don’t understand this documentation at all! I’m trying to add a Snapshot that picks up the sale percentage as a property when someone clicks on a product on this page: https://naturebox.com/
Could you help me out by writing this custom JS for me and explaining to me how I can do this myself in the future? I’d really appreciate it!

> I think all of the data is up and running for our account and we’ve finished our implementation! Now we just need to finalize the model for lead source attribution using this data. As a refresher, we want to attribute leads across 3 equally weighted touches across:

a. First Touch: First event recorded 
b. Account Creation: First time a customer completes their account 
c. First Order: First time a customer completes their order 

> For all of these, I imagine we will want to pull the UTM from the session where the event occurred. Is that the correct approach? 

> Where I'm running into trouble is in identifying where in our SQL database I should actually query the data. There aren't many fields available in the 'all_events' Heap table and I don’t get the difference between the all_events tables and the individual event table in Heap SQL. Where should I find this data?

> Assuming I want to keep our attribution model simple, could you help me write a SQL query that equally weights attribution by UTM source for these events or at least point me in the right direction of what I’d need to do to start building this out?
